# LiftingLug-FEA
3rd year Mechanical Engineering coursework project  of finite element analysis on a GCU lifting lug. This project consists of conducting structural integrity investigation using FEA on ABAQUS CAE and investigation of failure modes using MATLAB.

ASM_1944637.pdf is the final analysis report consisting FEA investigation of the lifting lug design and failure of material analysis on the lug component.

q1c_new.m is a MATLAB code where brittle failure possibility is investigated by analysing the most dangerous crack orientation.

FOM_1c.m is a MATLAB code where ductile failure mode is investigated by analysing the effective fracture toughness values.

partC_2a.m is a MATLAB code where probability of failure depending on inspection interval is investigated.
